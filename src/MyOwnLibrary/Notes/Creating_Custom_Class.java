-> Primitive data Types
   - Built into the language
   - Foundation of all other types
   - Four categories of primitives
        - Integer
        - Floating point
        - Character
        - Boolean

-> Java is a Object Oriented Language

Class is a blueprint. It comes first, Object is created out of the class


-> Instance variable belongs to instance of the class
-> Instance method
         - Instance method has direct access to instance variables
